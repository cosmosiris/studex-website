    <p>I used to dismantle and take apart the electronic toys my parents bought me from a young age. They bought me an electric racing car and I took it apart to see how it works and what made it work. </p>
    <p>As a young aspiring entrepreneur from a young age selling his sister magazine cuttings, I would send my sister to my mom to ask her for money when I was 6 and she was 2 years old.</p>
    <p>Over the years I was intrigued by computers science and engineering, playing games and upgrading computers. and learning about programing.</p>
    <p>In high school, I gained more knowledge about programming and financial markets. IN high school I traded mock accounts, 2005 my business partner Nick Rowley and I ran a mock account in JSE schools challenge and came top 5 in the country. We learned how to trade from Nicks Mentor, so we simulated his strategies into our trading platforms. This was my first experience and love for platforms.</p>
    <p>The following year I ran a live account with real money returning 30% in 11 months between friends and family. This was my first experience as an asset manager.</p>
    <p>After completing my Bachelor of commerce I realized that the real people who were making the money were the people whose companies were so worried about trading. All these listed companies were created by entrepreneurs.</p>
    <p>I needed to create my own exchange and my own market. I worked at McDonalds South Africa as an operations analyst, I rolled out the MCD delivery service and ran it as a startup. This taught me how to look at the volatility of transactions and money movement throughout the whole chain.</p>
    <p>After 6 years at Mcdonalds I enrolled at Hult International Business COllege to read a Masters of international business science. One one of the modules was a startup challenge. To solve a problem and create a business around it.  This was the birth place of studex. I used the time at school to research and develop and online exchange.</p>
    <p>On weekends I would help on the farm and go to auctions with my family. During this time growing up my love for the animals on the farm gave me the idea to explore the possibility of a crypto currency backed by the animals as collateral. Essentially creating the first cryptocurrency for animal conservation. </p>
